# Native File Dialog #

A tiny, neat C library that portably invokes native file open, folder select and save dialogs.  Write dialog code once and have it pop up native dialogs on all supported platforms.  Avoid linking large dependencies like wxWidgets and qt.

Features:

 - Lean C API, static library -- no ObjC, no C++, no STL.
 - Zlib licensed.
 - Consistent UTF-8 support on all platforms.
 - Simple universal file filter syntax.
 - Paid support available.
 - Multiple file selection support.
 - 64-bit and 32-bit friendly.
 - GCC, Clang, Xcode, Mingw and Visual Studio supported.
 - No third party dependencies for building or linking.
 - Support for Vista's modern `IFileDialog` on Windows.
 - Support for non-deprecated Cocoa APIs on OS X.
 - GTK3 dialog on Linux.
 - Optional Zenity support on Linux to avoid linking GTK.
 - Tested, works alongside [http://www.libsdl.org](SDL2) on all platforms, for the game developers out there.

# Example Usage #

```C
#include <nfd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main( void )
{
    nfdchar_t *outPath = NULL;
    nfdresult_t result = NFD_OpenDialog( NULL, NULL, &outPath );
        
    if ( result == NFD_OKAY ) {
        puts("Success!");
        puts(outPath);
        free(outPath);
    }
    else if ( result == NFD_CANCEL ) {
        puts("User pressed cancel.");
    }
    else {
        printf("Error: %s\n", NFD_GetError() );
    }

    return 0;
}
```

See self-documenting API [NFD.h](src/include/nfd.h) for more options.

## Building ##

NFD uses [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/download.html) generated Makefiles and IDE project files.  The generated project files are checked in under `build/` so you don't have to download and use Premake in most cases.

If you need to run Premake5 directly, further [build documentation](docs/build.md) is available.

Previously, NFD used SCons to build.  As of 1.1.6, SCons support has been removed entirely.

`nfd.a` will be built for release builds, and `nfd_d.a` will be built for debug builds.

### Makefiles ###

The makefile offers up to four options, with `release_x64` as the default.

    make config=release_x86
    make config=release_x64
    make config=debug_x86
    make config=debug_x64

### Installing nativefiledialog (vcpkg)

Alternatively, you can build and install nativefiledialog using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ./vcpkg integrate install
    ./vcpkg install nativefiledialog

The nativefiledialog port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.

### Compiling Your Programs ###

 1. Add `src/include` to your include search path.
 2. Add `nfd.lib` or `nfd_d.lib` to the list of list of static libraries to link against (for release or debug, respectively).
 3. Add `build/<debug|release>/<arch>` to the library search path.

#### Linux GTK ####

`apt-get libgtk-3-dev` installs the gtk dependency for library compilation.

On Linux, you have the option of compiling and linking against GTK.  If you use it, the recommended way to compile is to include the arguments of `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0`.

#### Linux Zenity ####

Alternatively, you can use the Zenity backend by running the Makefile in `build/gmake_linux_zenity`.  Zenity runs the dialog in its own address space, but requires the user to have Zenity correctly installed and configured on their system.

#### MacOS ####

On Mac OS, add `AppKit` to the list of frameworks.

#### Windows ####

On Windows, ensure you are linking against `comctl32.lib`.

## Usage ##

See `NFD.h` for API calls.  See `tests/*.c` for example code.

After compiling, `build/bin` contains compiled test programs.  The appropriate subdirectory under `build/lib` contains the built library.

## File Filter Syntax ##

There is a form of file filtering in every file dialog API, but no consistent means of supporting it.  NFD provides support for filtering files by groups of extensions, providing its own descriptions (where applicable) for the extensions.

A wildcard filter is always added to every dialog.

### Separators ###

 - `;` Begin a new filter.
 - `,` Add a separate type to the filter.

#### Examples ####

`txt` The default filter is for text files.  There is a wildcard option in a dropdown.

`png,jpg;psd` The default filter is for png and jpg files.  A second filter is available for psd files.  There is a wildcard option in a dropdown.

`NULL` Wildcard only.

## Iterating Over PathSets ##

See [test_opendialogmultiple.c](test/test_opendialogmultiple.c).

# Known Limitations #

I accept quality code patches, or will resolve these and other matters through support.  See [contributing](docs/contributing.md) for details.

 - No support for Windows XP's legacy dialogs such as `GetOpenFileName`.
 - No support for file filter names -- ex: "Image Files" (*.png, *.jpg).  Nameless filters are supported, however.
 - GTK Zenity implementation's process exec error handling does not gracefully handle numerous error cases, choosing to abort rather than cleanup and return.
 - GTK 3 spams one warning per dialog created.
